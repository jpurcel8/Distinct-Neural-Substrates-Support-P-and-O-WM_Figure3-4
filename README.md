# Data for Purcell, Rapp, and Martin (2021) Distinct neural substrates support phonological and orthographic working memory: Implications for theories of working memory
Contains data and code to generate Figures 3 and 4 for Purcell, Rapp, and Martin (2021) Distinct neural substrates support phonological and orthographic 
working memory:  Implications for theories of working memory 

# Instructions: 
Download "Distinct Neural Substrates Support P and O-WM_Figure3-4_Data.zip", unzip, and then add to your matlab path.
This folder contains the output files from the multiple VLSM analyses that can be viewed in a MRI image viewer program, and Matlab code used to generate 
the figures in this paper.

# Figure 3 Data
Use the all_lesions.nii; an example software that can be used to view this file is MRIcron - https://www.nitrc.org/projects/mricron

# Figure 4 Data
See the function Figure4_image_generator.m . Open it in Matlab to see code used to generate the figures, or simply type Figure4_image_generator into 
your command line (the main folder will need to be added to your matlab path). The brain image files used have thier paths listed in the Figure4_image_generator.m file, and 
can be opened in any brain imaging software as well (e.g., MRIcron).
